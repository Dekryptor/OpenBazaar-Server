# OpenBazaar + Zeronet

We are actively working to add OpenBazaar in [Zeronet](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet).

## Reclaiming Darkmarket Project

[Darkmarket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHVqH8XO1Pk#t=86)

The original project share a vision of a community based uncensored freemarket. Openbazaar team fork the original project and after getting a [fund](https://blog.openbazaar.org/openbazaar-is-entering-a-new-phase-with-funding/) they seemed to missed the point. Openbazaar does not share the same vision and after mainnet version was released the only thing they share is disappointment among the bitcoin and opensource [communities](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/4f18b5/openbizarre_developer_gets_very_sad_locks_grammar/). It is [clearly] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXszuDQwGHw) that privacy and anonymization its not projects priority and the whole project was build in a protocol (rudp) that does not support tor or any other anonymization utilities. A freemarket cannot exist with a visible ip and indentities/activities easily associated with personnal info.

This projects aims to reclaim a community based project driven by community needs.

###Zeronet vs Openbazaar

*  Network stability / Not stable yet 
*  Offers anonymity via tor hidden services / Ip is not hidden
*  Seeding shop/pages(no single point of failure) / If you close app your store goes offline (ipfs still in pre-alpha)
*  Running offline (browsing) / Running only with internet connection
